I'm a computer scientist with a keen interest in cyber security. Having completed my undergraduate studies in 2022, I began my current position as a PhD student, focusing on secure software development.

Following careful personal reflection, I have decided that transitioning from academia into industry will better fit my motivations, allowing me to directly contribute to real-world scenarios. I have developed a range of technical and analytical skills during my time spent working on state-of-the-art research, and I am keen to apply myself and my skills to new exciting opportunities.

You are welcome to explore this site to find out more about my projects, [publications](/publications), training, education and goals. Feel free to get in touch via email with any questions, or connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my progress!
