title = "Do names echo semantics? A large-scale study of identifiers used in C++{\textquoteright}s named casts",
abstract = "Developers relax restrictions on a type to reuse methods with other types. While type casts are prevalent, in weakly typed languages such as C++, they are also extremely permissive. Assignments where a source expression is cast into a new type and assigned to a target variable of the new type, can lead to software bugs if performed without care. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to identify poor implementations of explicit cast operations. Our approach measures accord between the source expression and the target variable using conditional entropy. We collect casts from 34 components of the Chromium project, which collectively account for 27MLOC and random-uniformly sample this dataset to create a manually labelled dataset of 271 casts. Information-theoretic vetting of these 271 casts achieves a peak precision of 81% and a recall of 90%. We additionally present the findings of an in-depth investigation of notable explicit casts, two of which were fixed in recent releases of the Chromium project.",

title = "Checking Test Suite Efficacy Through Dual-Channel Techniques",
abstract = "Dynamic Call Graphs trace program execution and are used to model function coverage. They help identify which function calls are missed but do not offer insights on whether those calls are important to cover. We propose a weighted representation of control flow called Natural Call Graphs (NCGs), which can be used to identify important function calls. These weights represent the relevance of the callee to the caller and are computed using information-theoretic reasoning on tokens in the functions. We create a dataset of 1,234 manually verified function calls, containing a mix of relevant and irrelevant functions, from ten Python open-source projects. On this dataset, our approach achieves a peak precision of 78% and a recall of 94% in identifying relevant functions missed by tests.",

@preprint{devperceptions,
title = "Perceptions of Secure Software Development: A Qualitative Study of Software Engineers in the UK",
abstract = "There are differences between developing software in the USA and the UK, ranging from variances in coding standards and industry practices to disparities in work culture and market dynamics. This study aims to provide an initial qualitative account of the experiences of software developers in the UK while developing secure code. We address two key research areas: (1) the degree of concern among software developers regarding security, (2) the reasons behind developers{\textquoteright} decisions to adopt, or disregard, certain dependency management and automated tooling techniques. Through interviews with nine developers, a deeper understanding of the human factors influencing secure code development in the UK was obtained. Preliminary results show that UK-based developers are influenced by: organisational, individual, and social factors, more work is needed to conclude how these are influenced by a UK national context.",
